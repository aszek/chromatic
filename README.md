Graph coloring lecture notes
============================

Contents
--------

This repository contains the lecture notes for *Graph coloring*. The final product is the file ``tex/final.pdf``. The website of the spring 2016 course edition is ``http://aszek.net/chromatic``. Currently in preparation.


Files
------

* ``tex/final.pdf`` --- the PDF file with the lecture notes.
* ``tex`` --- source files of the lecture notes. To compile, run ``pdflatex final.tex``.
* ``website`` --- the original material from the course website.


Editing

The skeleton file ``final.tex`` contains the common setup, TeX command definitions and bibliography. Each chapter is contained in a separate TeX file and can be edited independently of the rest (hopefully).
