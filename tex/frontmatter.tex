\chapter{Preface}

These lecture notes come from a master-level course \emph{Graph coloring}, taught by the first author at the University of Copenhagen in spring 2016.

Despite the name it is \emph{not} a comprehensive course in graph coloring. Instead, graph coloring problems serve only as a convenient excuse to familiarize the students, who may never have taken a more advanced combinatorics course, with interesting combinatorial techniques. The purpose is rather to give a taste of tools from linear algebra, calculus, combinatorics and geometry and demonstrate a few classical combinatorial theorems and their applications. It also has a bit of an experimental flavour and includes short programming exercises in Sage.

We are grateful for the contribution by the students who took notes during the course: Giorgia Laura Cassis, Hugr\'un Fj\'ola Hafsteinsd\'ottir, Rolf J{\o}rgensen, Mathis Elmgaard Isaksen, Sokratis Theodoridis, Mortan Janusarson Thomsen, Kristoffer Holm Nielsen.
